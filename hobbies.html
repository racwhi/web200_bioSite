          Shelley enjoyed shopping for and with her daughter. Two of their
          favorite stores were Kohl's and Target. Going to Target was an
          experience for them; they would stop at Starbucks and pick up a hot
          chocolate. Talked about their day as they walked around the store and,
          like most would say, "shopped until they dropped." Shelley was always
          with her daughter when she was not in the hospital. Shelley ensured
          she spent as much time as she could with her daughter. Shelley enjoyed
          cooking and eating. She had a few restaurants that she enjoyed.Shelley
          also enjoyed traveling when she was able to travel. Shelley loved her
          family. Shelley enjoyed spending time with family, organizing family
          events, and helping aunts, cousins, and anyone in need.
