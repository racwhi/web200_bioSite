          Shelley White is my sister, and this bioSite project is about my
          sister and grief. My sister passed away February 2023 from
          complications of type 1 diabetes, also known as juvenile diabetes.
          Shelley was diagnosed at the age of 13, and she fought the disease
          every day until her body could no longer fight. Shelley was a
          beautiful, intelligent, caring,respectful , brave, strong and kind
          person. She had a heart of gold. She was someone you could always
          count on. Shelley was and is the bravest, strongest person I know.
          Throughout her illness, she never complained. Shelley tried to live
          life to the best of her ability. Shelley's greatest joy in life was
          being a mother to her daughter; the two were inseparable. Shelley
          loved her family with all her heart. Even though Shelley was ill, her
          death was unexpected. When Shelley died, it was and still is a pain
          like no other .Adjusting has been difficult for me.

            "What is grief? Grief is a natural response to loss. It’s the
            emotional suffering you feel when something or someone you love is
            taken away. Often, the pain of loss can feel overwhelming. You may
            experience all kinds of difficult and unexpected emotions, from
            shock or anger to disbelief, guilt, and profound sadness. The pain
            of grief can also disrupt your physical health, making it difficult
            to sleep, eat, or even think straight. These are normal reactions to
            loss—and the more significant the loss, the more intense your grief
            will be. Coping with the loss of someone or something you love is
            one of life’s biggest challenges. You may associate grieving with
            the death of a loved one—which is often the cause of the most
            intense type of grief—but any loss can cause grief, including: Even
            subtle losses in life can trigger a sense of grief."</em
